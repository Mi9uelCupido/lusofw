## About MeshCore

MeshCore is a lightweight, portable C++ library that enables multi-hop packet routing for embedded projects using LoRa and other packet radios. It is designed for developers who want to create resilient, decentralized communication networks that work without the internet.

## About lusofw
Lusofw is the official MeshCore firmware distribution tailored specifically for the Portuguese community. This project aims to enhance the user experience with quality-of-life improvements while maintaining compatibility with the upstream MeshCore repository.

### Philosophy

This is not intended to be a hard fork of the upstream repository. Instead, lusofw serves as:

- A release channel with curated quality-of-life improvements
- A testing ground for features that will eventually be merged upstream
- A community-focused distribution that provides faster access to enhancements
